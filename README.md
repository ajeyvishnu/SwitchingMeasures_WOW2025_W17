# Workout Wednesday 2025 | Week 17 | EPL Greatest Team Analysis

This Tableau dashboard explores the question of which team might be considered the greatest English Premier League (EPL) team of all time. Using historical data, the visualization allows users to interactively explore cumulative performance measures for teams over the seasons. The primary focus of this project is **measure switching**, a fundamental Tableau technique.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Measure Switching**: Choose between four measures: Points, Goal Difference, Goals For, and Goals Against.
- **Highlight a Team**: Highlight a selected team's bar in a distinct color and show its position across seasons.
- **Season Scroller**: Manually scroll through seasons to visualize how team standings evolve over time.
- **Dynamic Sorting**: Sort bars dynamically based on the selected measure, prioritizing higher values (or lower for Goals Against).
- **Tooltip Details**: Display both the current season’s selected measure and the cumulative value in tooltips.
- **Conditional Display**: Show teams only when they have earned points in a season.

## 💡 Bonus Challenge
- **Centered Bar Chart**: Optionally display bars centered on a horizontal line, with minimal spacing for negative Goal Differences.
